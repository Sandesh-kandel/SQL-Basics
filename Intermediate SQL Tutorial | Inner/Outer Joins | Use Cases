//Inner Join: An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values
in both tables involved in the join.
If there is no match between the join columns of the two tables,
those rows will be excluded from the result set.

Right Outer Join: A right outer join is the opposite of a left outer join. It returns all the rows
from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the columns of the left table.
